# Ardh Naari Shakti Taara Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the Ardh Naari Shakti Taara platform pledge to make participation in our community a safe, respectful, and harassment-free experience for everyone, especially transgenders and marginalized individuals. We celebrate diversity in gender identity, expression, background, and experience.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, inclusive, and supportive environment, upholding the dignity and privacy of all users.

## Our Standards

Examples of positive behavior include:

* Demonstrating empathy, kindness, and respect for all individuals
* Using inclusive language and respecting chosen names and pronouns
* Supporting marginalized voices and experiences
* Giving and accepting constructive feedback gracefully
* Respecting privacy and personal boundaries, especially regarding sensitive topics
* Focusing on what is best for the community and platform users

Unacceptable behavior includes:

* Discrimination, harassment, or bullying of any kind
* Use of sexualized language, imagery, or unwanted advances
* Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, especially targeting gender identity or marginalized groups
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information (such as physical or email address) without explicit permission
* Any conduct that threatens the safety, dignity, or privacy of community members
* Misuse of the AI assistant or platform features to harass, intimidate, or harm others

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers via Discord to our moderators. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, with respect for the privacy and security of the reporter.

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, please contact us directly or open an issue (for non-sensitive matters). We are committed to protecting the dignity and safety of all users.
