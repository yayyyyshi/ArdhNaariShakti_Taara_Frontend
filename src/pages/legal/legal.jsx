 <br></br> <br></br>

      {/* Section 2: Key Legal Milestones */}
  <div className="legal-section" id="RECOGNITION" >
  <h1>2. Recognition of Identity of Transgender Persons</h1>
<br></br>
  <p>
    Every transgender person has the legal right to be recognized and respected for who they are. The law ensures this through a step-by-step process for identity recognition and documentation.
  </p>
<br></br>
  <ul>
    <li>
       <strong>Right to be Recognized:</strong> Every transgender person has the right to be officially recognized as transgender under the law.
    </li>
    <li>
       <strong>Self-Perceived Gender Identity:</strong> A transgender person has the right to identify their own gender (self-perceived), and this must be respected.
    </li>
  </ul>
<br></br>
  <h3> <b>-Applying for a Certificate of Identity</b></h3>
  <br></br>
  <p>
    A transgender person can apply to the <strong>District Magistrate</strong> for an official certificate of identity.
    This certificate confirms their gender as transgender.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
       The application must be in the prescribed format and include the required documents.
    </li>
    <li>
       For minors, a parent or guardian must apply on their behalf.
    </li>
  </ul>
<br></br>
  <h3> <b>-Issuing the Certificate</b> </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
       1.The District Magistrate will review the application and issue a certificate identifying the applicant as transgender.
    </li>
    <li>
       2.This certificate will be accepted on all official documents, confirming the person’s gender identity as transgender.
    </li>
    <li>
       3.The certificate grants all legal rights and official recognition under the law.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br></br>

  <h3> <b>Changing Gender After Surgery</b></h3>
  <p>
    If a transgender person undergoes gender-affirming surgery (to identify as male or female), they can apply for a revised certificate.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
       1. A certificate from the <strong>Medical Superintendent or Chief Medical Officer</strong> is needed as proof of surgery.
    </li>
    <li>
       2. The District Magistrate will then issue a new certificate reflecting the changed gender.
    </li>
    <li>
       3. The person can also request a name change in their birth certificate and other official documents.
    </li>
    <li>
       4. Changing gender and name does <strong>not affect their legal rights</strong> under this Act.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This legal recognition process ensures that every transgender person is treated with dignity and is able to live as per their true identity—on paper and in real life.
  </p>

<br></br> <br></br>
<div className="legal-section" id="welfare-measures">
  <h1>3. Welfare Measures by the Government</h1>
<br></br>
  <p>
    The law ensures that the government takes active steps to support the transgender community and promote their inclusion in society. Here’s what the government is required to do:
  </p>
<br></br>
  <ul>
    <li>

<div className="legal-section" id="penalty">
  <h1>8. Offences and Penalties</h1>
  <br></br>
  <p>
    The law strictly protects transgender individuals from harm, abuse, and discrimination. Anyone who violates these rights can face serious legal consequences. Under the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, the following acts are considered offences:
  </p>
  <br></br>
  <p>
    (a) If anyone compels or entices a transgender person to engage in forced or bonded labour — which means making someone work against their will, without pay, or under threat — they are committing a punishable offence. However, this does not include compulsory services imposed by the government for public purposes.
  </p>
  <br></br>
  <p>
    (b) If a transgender person is denied the right to access public places — like parks, restaurants, hospitals, educational institutions, public transport, etc. — or is obstructed from using them when others are allowed to, this too is a punishable act.
  </p>
  <br></br>
  <p>
    (c) Forcing a transgender person to leave their home, village, or any place where they reside is a crime. Everyone has the right to live where they feel safe and accepted, and no one can force them to leave just because of their gender identity.
  </p>
  <br></br>
  <p>
    (d) Any act that harms or threatens the life, safety, physical or mental well-being of a transgender person is strictly prohibited. This includes:
    <ul>
      <li>Physical abuse (like hitting or injuring them)</li>
      <li>Sexual abuse (any unwanted sexual act)</li>
      <li>Verbal or emotional abuse (insults, threats, humiliation)</li>
      <li>Economic abuse (not allowing them access to money or basic needs)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <br></br>
  <p>
    Anyone found guilty of committing any of the above offences will be punished with imprisonment for a term not less than six months, which can be extended up to two years, and they may also have to pay a fine. These laws exist to ensure that transgender individuals can live with dignity, free from fear, and with full protection under the law.
  </p>
</div>
<br></br> <br></br>
<div className="legal-section" id="misc">
  <h1> Miscellaneous</h1>
  <br></br>
  <p> 
    The Central Government shall, from time to time and after due appropriation made by Parliament by law, credit such sums to the National Council as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of this Act. The provisions of this Act are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any other law in force. No suit, prosecution, or other legal proceeding shall lie against the appropriate Government, any local authority, or any Government officer for anything done or intended to be done in good faith under this Act or any rules made under it.
    <br /><br />
    The appropriate Government may, by notification and subject to prior publication, make rules for implementing the provisions of this Act. Such rules may include: (a) the form and manner of applications under Section 5; 
    (b) the procedure, form, manner, and period for issuing identity certificates under Section 6(1); (c) the form and manner of applications under Section 7(1); (d) the form, period, and manner of issuing revised certificates under Section 7(2); (e) welfare measures under Section 8(2); (f) facilities under Section 10; (g) other functions of the National Council under Section 17(e); and (h) any other matter required or permitted to be prescribed.
    <br /><br />
    Every rule made by the Central Government under Section 22(1) shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament for a total of thirty days (which may span one or more sessions). If both Houses agree to modify or annul the rule before the end of the session immediately following that period, the rule shall only take effect in its modified form or shall be void, without affecting previous actions taken under it. Similarly, rules made by the State Government shall be laid before the respective State Legislature—before both Houses where applicable or the single House where the Legislature is unicameral.
    <br /><br />
    If any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of this Act, the Central Government may, by order in the Official Gazette, make provisions not inconsistent with the Act to remove the difficulty—provided that no such order shall be made after two years from the commencement of the Act. Every such order shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as possible after it is made.
